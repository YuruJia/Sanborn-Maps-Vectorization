# Sanborn-Maps-Vectorization

This is a course project of Reseach Topics in Cartography at ETHz.

**Task**
- To create an automated pipeline that accurately and reliably extracts individual building geometries from Sanborn Map sheets and stores them as polygons in a vector format (.shp)
- To differentiate between color coded building material types (precisely: pink buildings = brick and light yellow (parts of) buildings = framework) and assign this information to the extracted polygons
